🎅🎁 Hey hey, Santa *PRATHUM WADHWA*! You've got a Child! 🎄

📚 *Your Child has described their book preference as*: I welcome FICTION novels that engage with social issues in innovative and compelling ways, such as through non-linear narratives, anthology formats, diary entries, or other experimental storytelling techniques. Specifically, I am interested in works that explore themes of marginality, identity, oppression, and violence, with a particular focus on politically and socially sensitive topics like mental health, Palestine, LGBTQ+ rights, state-sponsored oppression, tribal/Dalit rights, and other similar issues. I especially appreciate works from authors based in non-American contexts, particularly those from underrepresented parts of the world like Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East. However, if you know of a compelling book written by an American or Western author, I would be open to that as well. Indian authors are also welcome. Please note that I am not interested in mass-market, mass-appeal commercial authors like Stephen King, Danielle Steel, Chetan Bhagat, Colleen Hoover or others of a similar type. You may want to consider books that have received literary critical acclaim or some form of serious recognition. I look forward to your recommendations :)
